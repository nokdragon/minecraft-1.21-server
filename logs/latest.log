[11:08:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <matscan> Hello. I'm a friendly bot that scans the internet for Minecraft servers.
[11:08:35] [Server thread/INFO]: <matscan> This server isn't whitelisted, which means griefers can and probably will join it. To avoid this you must whitelist the server with the commands '/whitelist on' and '/whitelist add <player>'.
[11:08:36] [Server thread/INFO]: <matscan> If it was meant to be public, please ensure that the server is taking frequent backups to prevent permanent damage in the event that it is targeted.
